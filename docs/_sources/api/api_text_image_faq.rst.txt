Q1: What types of files can I upload in the Image Upload API?
-------------------------------------------------------------
A: The Image Upload API currently supports most common image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and GIF. Please ensure that your files conform to these formats before uploading.

Q2: How large can the text uploads be in the Text Upload API?
-------------------------------------------------------------
A: The Text Upload API is designed to handle typical text data sizes. However, we recommend that individual uploads do not exceed 10,000 characters to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

Q3: Is there any authentication required to access these APIs?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A: Yes, both APIs require user authentication. We use session-based authentication, so you must log in to establish a session before accessing the endpoints.

Q4: How do I handle errors or failures during uploads?
------------------------------------------------------
A: The API will return standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure. For example, a `400 Bad Request` indicates a problem with the input data, while a `500 Internal Server Error` suggests an issue on the server side. Check the response body for detailed error messages.

Q5: Can I update or delete previously uploaded data?
---------------------------------------------------
A: Yes, both the Text and Image Upload APIs allow you to update or delete your uploads. Use the PATCH method for updates and the DELETE method for removals, targeting the specific item's endpoint.

Q6: Are there any rate limits or quotas for using the APIs?
-----------------------------------------------------------
A: Currently, there are no strict rate limits. However, we expect users to use the APIs responsibly to avoid undue strain on the system. In case of excessive usage, we may consider implementing rate limits.

Q7: How secure are the Text and Image Upload APIs?
--------------------------------------------------
A: We take security seriously. The APIs are protected with session-based authentication, and data is transmitted over HTTPS. However, we recommend that users do not upload sensitive or personal data.

Q8: Is there any support for bulk uploads?
------------------------------------------
A: At the moment, the APIs do not support bulk uploads. Each upload request should contain a single text entry or image file.

Q9: Can I retrieve a list of all my previous uploads?
-----------------------------------------------------
A: Yes, you can retrieve a list of all your previous uploads by making a GET request to the base endpoint of each API (`/api/texts/` for Text Uploads and `/api/images/` for Image Uploads).

Q10: What should I do if I encounter a problem or have a question?
